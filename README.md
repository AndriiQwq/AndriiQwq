FIIT STU Student 🎓

Bachelor's (2023–2026)  
I am currently starting to gather materials and work on my bachelor's thesis, which focuses on language models and contextual analysis.  
This involves the exploration of different models and the variety of their applications in the contextual analysis of contracts.  
The work includes preprocessing contracts and applying different models to extract clauses and classify them.
