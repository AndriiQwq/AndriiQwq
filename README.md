FIIT STU Student 🎓

Bachelor's (2023–2026)  
I am developing an automated contract analysis system for Slovak legal documents using Large Language Models. The system extracts contract structure, classifies clauses by legal meaning, and supports multiple LLM providers (Gemini, Claude, Mistral, GPT, Qwen) through a FastAPI with configurable prompting strategies.

Cluster architecture provides higher reliability, flexibility, and scalability for virtualized environments.
Core benefits include:

- Shared storage — unified storage accessible by all nodes, simplifying VM management and data access.
- VM migration — support for both Offline and Live migration, allowing running virtual machines to move between nodes without downtime.
- High Availability (HA) — with three or more nodes, the cluster can automatically restart virtual machines on another node if one server fails.
- Centralized configuration — all nodes operate as a single system with synchronized configuration across the cluster.
- Load balancing — efficient distribution of workloads to optimize resource usage and performance.
- Convenient backups and recovery — backups can be created on one node and restored on another with minimal effort.

Kubernetes Perspective
In addition to virtualization clusters, I also work with Kubernetes, which provides:

- Container orchestration and automated scaling
- Self‑healing workloads (restart, reschedule, replace pods)
- Rolling updates & rollbacks
- Service discovery & networking
- Declarative infrastructure (IaC)
